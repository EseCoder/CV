## Professional Summary

I am an IT expert with software development, project management, problem-solving, and idea-generating skills. I have been in the industry since 2012, working in software development training, music streaming, Android OSes, and open-source software. I have designed, built, and maintained mobile, desktop, and web apps some of which are hosted on the cloud (AWS) and deployed as MVC, MVP, and MVVM infrastructures.
I have built projects using Java, Kotlin, PHP/Laravel, Javascript, XML, and HTML/CSS.

Recently, I have played around with the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and built a Firewall system app and 4 other apps with the CalyxOS team. I plan to contribute more open-source software with them and other open-source teams. I have an encrypted telephone voice call app in the works as part of my contributions. My remote work with the international no-profit organizations Internews and the Calyx Institute can prove my ability to work remotely effectively.
